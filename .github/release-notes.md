## What's new

- Monoform is on its way to the Microsoft Store: this version is the first one built as a Store package. Nothing else changes; 1.4.0 brought German and French.

## Downloads

| System | File |
|---|---|
| Windows 10/11 | `monoform-amd64-installer.exe` (installer; making it the default app is an unchecked option) or `monoform-windows-amd64-portable.zip` |
| macOS 11+ (Apple Silicon and Intel) | `monoform-macos-universal.zip` — unsigned: the first time, right-click the app and choose **Open** |
| Linux x86-64 | `monoform-linux-amd64.tar.gz` — unpack and run `./install.sh` (needs WebKitGTK 4.1) |

`SHA256SUMS` lists the checksums of all files (Monoform can verify it: open the file in the app).

Builds are not code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper will warn on first launch.
Everything runs offline; no telemetry, no account. Monoform is free and open source (MIT).
